# Lambdas for SMS Queue Service

Lambdas for sms queue service, which processes and sends the outbound SMS queue.

## Setup

The `developer` role is required to deploy this project.

### Node / NPM

1. [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. [NPM 8+](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### AWS Credentials

To run locally, [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is required in order to assume a role with permission to update resources. Install AWS CLI with:

```brew
brew install awscli
```

If file `~/.aws/credentials` does not exist, create it and add a default profile:

```toml
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
region=us-east-2
```

If necessary, generate a [new access key ID and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys).

Add a `developer` profile to the same credentials file:

```toml
[developer]
role_arn=arn:aws:iam::<account number>:role/developer
source_profile=default
mfa_serial=<YOUR_MFA_ARN>
region=us-east-2
```

If necessary, retreive the ARN of the primary MFA device attached to the default profile:

```bash
aws iam list-mfa-devices --query 'MFADevices[].SerialNumber' --output text
```

## Developing Locally

### Unit Tests

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) tests are run automatically on commit and push. If the test coverage threshold is not met, the push will fail. See `jest.config.ts` for coverage threshold.

Manually run tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Prettier / Linter

Both [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) are executed on commit. Manually prettify and lint code with:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Deploying to Production

When a pull request is merged into `master`, the lambda code is transpiled to commonjs and then deployed. Feature branches are also deployed but are given unique resources.
